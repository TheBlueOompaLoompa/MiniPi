# MiniPi
I've been wanting to make a somewhat usable OS for a while and I saw Arcade as an excuse to do it.
I think I've made it to the level where nothing will really stop me from completing this.
**Anyways,** MiniPi is an OS I will be making to run specifically on a Raspberry Pi 4B. The goal is to have a shell where I can execute programs from a filesystem.
Todolist:
- [ ] Setup toolchain
- [ ] Boot
  - [ ] Bootloader
  - [ ] Setup start kmain
  - [ ] QEMU for testing
  - [ ] Display hello world
- [ ] Kernel
  - [ ] Setup devices and whatnot probably
  - [ ] Interrupts (Nothing crazy, just inputs and system timers)
  - [ ] Memory shenanigans (Being able to add multitasking would be funny)
  - [ ] ?
